    <h1>Arrest to Arraignment</h1>
    <h2>A NYC Story</h2>
    <p>Since the <em>Roundtree vs. Brown</em> (1991) decision, New York state law mandates that the maximum time between when an individual suspected of a criminal act is arrested and their first appearance in court, arraignment, must occur within 24 hours. A complex series of steps must occur before this process is complete.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Scroll down to follow a typical arrest to arraignment story.</p>
    <small>Scroll â–¼</small>
  </section>
  
  <section id='scene'>
    <h2>Scene of Arrest</h2>
    <h2>174 East 86th Street</h2>
    <p>An individual suspected of a criminal act is handcuffed, detained by an NYPD Officer, and told their Miranda rights.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='precinct'>
    <h2>NYPD 19th Precinct</h2>
    <h2>153 East 67th Street</h2>
    <p>The defendant is brought to the police precinct, by the arresting officer, in which the arrest occurred. The 19th Precinct serves Manhattan's Upper East Side and is one of the 76 precincts throughout the 5 boroughs. After answering questions about the background of the defendant, the defendant is put in the precinct's holding cell with other defendants.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='ecab'>
    <h2>Early Case Assessment Bureau, Manhattan District Attorney's Office</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street</h2>
    <p>The arresting police officer faxes a copy of the Arrest Report to the Assistant District Attorney of the borough where the crime took place with the facts of the arrest and suspect information.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>If the ADA decides to prosecute the case, he or she will draft a  Complaint, which includes the crimes the defendant is charged with. The ADA faxes a copy of the Complaint to the arresting officer for review.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='precinct'>
    <h2>NYPD 19th Precinct</h2>
    <h2>153 East 67th Street</h2>
    <p>If the officer agrees with the charges, the officer signs the now Sworn Complaint and faxes it back to the DA's Office which starts the criminal prosecution.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='central-booking'>
    <h2>Manhattan Criminal Court Central Booking</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street</h2>
    <p>Defendants are taken in police vans to Central Booking. Each borough has its own criminal court each with their own Central Booking. Mug shots, fingerprints, and a scan of the defendant's irises are taken. A Movement Slip with the mugshot, NYPD charges, and other arrest information is created and accompanies the defendant. 
  </section>

  <section id='dcjs'>
  <h2>New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services</h2>
    <h2>80 South Swan Street, Albany</h2>
    <p>A copy of the fingerprints are sent for processing to DCJS in Albany. The criminal history associated with the defendant's fingerprints are matched within New York and for each individual state for which a rap sheet exists.
   </p>
  </section>

  <section id='holding-pens'>
    <h2>Manhattan Criminal Court Holding Pens</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street</h2>
    <p>While at Central Booking, defendants are interviewed by the Criminal Justice Agency in order to generate a Release on Recognizance report.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>CJA interviews every on-line arrestee in NYC. Their report gives a recommendation on whether the defendant is likely to not return at a future court date if released from police custody.  A defendant could be: Recommended for R.O.R.; Medium Risk for R.O.R.; Not Recommended for R.O.R.; or No Recommendation. Factors include:
      <ul>
      <li>Does the defendant report a NYC address?</li>
      <li>Does the defendant have a working telephone in his or her residence, or a cell phone?</li>
      <li>Is defendant employed, in school, or in a training program full time?</li>
      <li>Does defendant expect someone at arraignment?</li>
      <li>Does the defendant have prior bench warrants?</li>    
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='breakdown-room'>
  <h2>NYPD Breakdown Room</h2>
    <h2>unknown</h2>
    <p>The Sworn Complaint from the ADA and NYPD, the criminal history and fingerprints from DCJS, and the CJA report on bail recommendation are received and matched at the NYPD Breakdown Room.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='oca'>
  <h2>Clerk's Office, Office of Court Administration (or Manhattan Criminal Court?)</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street</h2>
    <p>The matched paperwork is consolidated into a court packet. A docket number is assigned to the packet and its information is initialized into the Court's electronic case system, CRIMS. The clerk assigns the case to a courtroom, known as a part, for arraignment. The clerk also checks the Court's electronic system for warrants and summonses (SAMS), Sex Offender notices, and Order of Protections from the Domestic Violence Registry for matches to the defendant.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='dcjs'>
    <h2>New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services</h2>
    <h2>80 South Swan Street, Albany</h2>
    <p>An updated case report with docket information is sent to DCJS to update the defendant's criminal history. </p>
  </section>

  <section id='oca'>
    <h2>Clerk's Office, Office of Court Administration (or Manhattan Criminal Court?)</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street</h2>
    <p>The clerk prints and attaches any warrants, summonses, notices, and orders to Court Packets. NYPD and the DA pick-up completed packets from Clerk's Office. The packets for the court and for the defense are brought to the appropriate court part.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='interview-pens'>
    <h2>Interview Pens, Manhattan Criminal Court</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street</h2>
    <p>Upon receipt of the court packet, including the Movement Slip, NYPD brings up specified defendant to interview pens behind the courtroom. The defendant is met by the defense counsel, either a private attorney hired by the defendant or a city-provided indigent defense attorney.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='nypd-desk'>
    <h2>NYPD Desk</h2>
    <h2>100 Centre Street, Room 129</h2>
    <p>The defendant is first brought here at arraignment court. An NYPD officer scans the defendant's eyes to verify his or her identity with the iris scan taken at Central Booking.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>This eye-scan was adopted as part of the process in 2010 after a man that had been charged with five armed robberies posed as a defendant charged with a minor drug offense. The defendant was released rather than having had bail set. </p>
  </section>

  <section id='benches'>
  <h2>Benches</h2>
    <h2>Room 129</h2>
    <p>Defendants awaiting to be seen by a judge are brought to the benches.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='court-interview'>
    <h2>Courtroom Interview Pen</h2>
    <h2>Room 129</h2>
    <p>The interview pen within the courtroom are another option for a defendant and his or her counsel to speak with confidentiality.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='defense-stand'>
    <h2>Court Officer's Desk</h2>
    <h2>Room 129</h2>
    <p>The Court's copy of the Court Papers are given to the court officer. The Court Officer calls out the docket number and the defendant to the stand and then hands the Court's copy to the Judge.</p>
    </section>

  <section id='interview-pens'>
    <h2>Defense Stand</h2>
    <h2>Room 129</h2>
    <p>Defendant joins  his or her lawyer at the defense stand alongside the ADA's stand.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The ADA names the criminal charge or charges the defendant is accused of, describes the details of the case, presents any pertinent criminal history, and proposes a bail amount, based on the CJA recommendation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The defense attorney presents the details of the case from the point of view of the defendant and will counter the ADA's bail proposal with either a lower amount or a request for ROR. In some cases a case may be disposed of at arraignment, in which the ADA, Defense, and the Judge come to an agreement if the defendant pleas guilty.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='judge-bench'>
    <h2>Judge's Bench</h2>
    <h2>Room 129</h2>
    <p>Upon hearing from the ADA, representing either the victim or the people of the city of New York, and the defense, the judge makes a decision to either dispose the case (dismiss charges, time served, set a fine, sentence to an alternative program, set a jail sentence), ROR the defendant to appear at a later court date, or set bail for the defendant.</p>
    <p>In 2012, 51% of cases at arraignments were disposed, settled either by the case being dismissed or the judge sentencing a penalty of time served, a fine, or jail sentence.</p>
  </section>

  <section id='end-cover'>
   <h2>Post-Arraignment</h2>
    <p>If the case is dismissed or if the defendant is given time served or ROR, he or she is free from police custody and is able to leave the courtroom that day. If the defendant is sentenced to jail time or has had bail set, he or she remains in police custody and will be escorted by NYPD to a holding cell.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The police then have 24 hours to get the defendant from arraignment to a jail bed.</p>
